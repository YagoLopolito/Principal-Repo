(Editor’s note: No, there’s only like 350.) But most of them are locked when you start, and while completing all of the story missions will unlock some of these heroes and villains from a galaxy far far away, you’ll still need to work to acquire most of the others.Luckily, there exist a few codes that can speed up the process and also unlock some of the game’s more silly or strange characters. Using these codes will let you save the studs you would’ve normally had to spend on unlocking them.SIDIOUS - Emperor Palpatine characterLIFEDAY - GNK Droid (Christmas variant)WOOKIEE - Chewbacca (Christmas variant)TIPYIPS - D-O Droid (Christmas variant)KORDOKU - Poe Dameron (Christmas variant)WROSHYR - Darth Vader (Christmas variant)3FCPPVX - Grand Moff TarkinZ55T8CQ - Poggle The LesserWBFE4GO - Nute GunrayGR2VBXF - Ratts TyerellARVALA7 - Razor Crest (Mandalorian’s ship)SHUTTLE - Galaxy’s Edge/Resistance transport shipOKV7TLR - Dengar (bounty hunter) characterXV4WND9 - Admiral Holdo characterIf you’re wondering where I got these codes, don’t worry, I didn’t steal them from a Bothan spy or anything. These codes came from two places. Some codes were sent to us and other outlets to be shared with you, our fine readers. And the other codes were originally included in various Star Wars-themed Lego sets, some of which I bought myself. But those sets were released in 2020, back before all the delays, so most of them are hard to find now.
